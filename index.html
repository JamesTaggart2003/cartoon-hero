	<h2>About Richard</h2>
	<p>Richard is a fat pink bunny. That's pretty much it to be honest, but that doesn't stop him from being the most supportive father ever known to bunnykind, caring husband and an avid explorer. Just don't let him get employed. Take my word here, that's going to be a huge mess.</p>
